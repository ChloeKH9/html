   <h2 id="intro">Why?</h2>

     For the past year, a large part of my life has involved catering to the whims of a small, unhinged, adorable captor (see above). In the beginning, music would soothe Dylan, and help keep him asleep during his numerous naps throughout the day. He was particularly fond of a spotify playlist seeded with the hip-hop group <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E4uZwg8xvOgHm">Jurassic 5</a>. But more recently, music has become and active part of his day, and while he occasionally enjoys more adult-oriented music, he's more likely to get down to children's music. Thankfully, it's not all as bad as I had feared.

   <h2>The Wiggles</h2>

     The Wiggles are an Australian group formed back in 1991. I was unaware of them until much more recently. Each Wigle has an associated color. Originally The Wiggles were Anthony (Blue), Greg (Yellow), Jeff (Purple) and Murray (Red). In 2013, the yellow, purple and red willges were replaced by Emma, Lachy and Simon respectively, while Anthony has remained as the Blue Wiggle. On the homefront, I can say that "Fruit Salad", "Big Red Car" and "Do the Propeller" are crowd pleasers, in that they please Dylan and therefore please everyone. I have found myself enjoying a few of their songs, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlBjxDXon1s">The James Cafe Ballet</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsHczArqsSY">Rattlin' Bog</a>.

     Let me take you back to 1995, when a young Mr. DW became obsessed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Presidents_of_the_United_States_of_America_(band)">The Presidents of the United States of America</a> (PUSA for short). PUSA was an alternative rock band with farily nonsensical songs like "Lump", "Peaches" and "Feather Pluckin'". They didn't take thsemselves very seriously, and were an excellent counter point to the heavier grunge bands like Pearl Jam and Nirvana (which I also loved). Fast forward to 2020, when I discover that Chris Ballew, former lead singer of PUSA, has became a childern's artist under the moniker <a href="https://babypantsmusic.com/home">Caspar Babypants</a>. Mr. Babypants has certainly channeled his irreverence from his PUSA days to a younger audience. Favorites here include "Free Couch", "Disco Hippo", and "Stompy the Bear".
