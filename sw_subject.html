   <h2>Capital Ships</h2>
   <p>
     Capital ships were large vehicles that formed the backbone of the Rebel Fleet. They could be 100-1500 meters in length, and had hundreds of crew members. They were well armed, and would also house space and ground military forces. For a time the ship <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Home_One">Home One</a> served as the base of operations for the rebellion.

   <h2>Fighters</h2>

     Fighters were small craft designed for sapce combat. They susually had a crew of 1 or 2, along with an <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Astromech_droid">astromech droid</a>. The X-Wing (pictured below) was one of the most popular fighters in the rebellion's fleet.

   <h2>Freighters</h2>
   <p>
     Freighters were medium sized ships, not as nimble as fighters, but nowhere near as large as capital ships. They could have varying crew sizes, though normally would have at least 2 members. They were commonly armed for defense, but not useful as offensive vessels. Freighters were not specifically part of the Rebellion fleet, but they still served a vital purpose. Often commanded by civilians, frighters were used to transport resources to those in need. There are examples of modfied freighters being used in the Reblleion though. The most well known were the Ghost and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Falcon">Millenium Falcon</a>.
